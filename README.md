## Introduction
The project aims to create a flight traffic simulator, allowing tracking of flights and ground stations at multiple airports and addressing air traffic control issues using graph theory algorithms.

## First Mission: Airport Control System
The simulator's initial mission is to simulate an airport control system, taking into account various local parameters for each airport and aircraft.

### Local Parameters for Airports and the Airport Network
- Airport name
- Airport location (GPS coordinates)
- Number of runways
- Number of ground stations
- Ground station wait time
- Runway access time
- Anti-collision delay
- Takeoff and landing time
- Duration of holding pattern in the air
- Distance to other airports

### Local Parameters for Aircraft
- Aircraft type (short, medium, or long-haul)
- Fuel consumption
- Fuel capacity

## Advanced Missions
The project includes more ambitious missions, such as handling weather disturbances, avoiding collisions, handling fuel leakage, studying flight flows, and addressing global energy crises.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
- Object-oriented C++ language
- Console and/or graphical environment for input and display
